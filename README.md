‚ÄúDavis‚Äôs accounts of small fights won by hot blood and cold steel are thrilling.‚Äù‚ÄîThe Wall Street Journal

From master historian William C. Davis, the definitive story of the Battle of New Orleans, the fight that decided the ultimate fate not only of the War of 1812 but the future course of the fledgling American republic.

It was a battle that could not be won. Outnumbered farmers, merchants, backwoodsmen, smugglers, slaves, and Choctaw Indians, many of them unarmed, were up against the cream of the British army,

The Greatest Fury: The Battle of New Orleans and the Rebirth of America by William C Davis Book Review

Name: Fred Hybart
Rating: 3.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Not bad, but has one continuous and egregious error
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019
Review: Professor Davis is a good writer, no doubt, and he has brought many new interesting facts to the story of this great battle. However, he made what I consider an egregious error, particularly for an academic of his standing who should, I believe, know better.

Following the British withdrawal from Louisiana after their defeat at New Orleans, they proceeded to lay siege to American-held Ft. Bowyer on Mobile Bay. As Ft. Bowyer was surrounded and and heavily outnumbered by the British, it was forced to surrender in fairly short order. A few days later word reached the British fleet of the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812 (pending ratification of the treaty by the British and American governments).

Unfortunately, Professor Davis incorrectly places Ft. Bowyer (which he doesn't even bother to identify by name), on Dauphin Island, on the west side of the entrance to Mobile Bay. In fact, Ft. Bowyer was on Mobile Point, which is on the east side of the bay entrance (and where Ft. Morgan, of Civil War fame, would later be located, almost on top of where Ft. Bowyer was). Professor Davis identified Dauphin Island as the fort's location not just once, but repeatedly.

Of course in the overall scheme of things, the action at Ft. Bowyer had no bearing on the war, but it is very disappointing, and quite surprising actually, that Professor Davis made this kind of error.

Title: great insight
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2020
Review: Wonderful retelling of an historic victory in a forgotten war. Author explains the cultural background and divided loyalties on the American frontier, tactical decisions of British and American generals, along with costly mistakes that change history. Worth the read to learn how the British approached New Orleans by long surreptitious route through lagoons and bayous. Never realized the battle was a month long campaign ... you can almost feel the the British shivering in the damp cold, and see the sugar cane stubble and drainage ditches separating the two armies.

Title: Excellent read!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2020
Review: I loved how the author told the story from both sides of the conflict. He captured the fight, struggle and desperation of both the Brits and the Yanks. It truly gave me more of an appreciation to be an American and how lucky we are to have had so many allies from so many cultures and walks of life shape our country. God bless.

Title: complete and in-depth
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2019
Review: This was the most complete and insightful study of the Battle of New Orleans I have ever read. The book mixed personal details with descriptions of the larger action that made it an easy read. The in-depth treatment of post-war events and personal outcomes of even minor players was fantastic. This is a "must read" for anyone curious about New Orleans and the War of 1812.

Title: Interesting rendition of a battle that most don‚Äôt know much about
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2019
Review: The British thought they would waltz into New Orleans and easily take the city. However, Andrew Jackson mounted a brilliant defense, which seriously maimed an army that had recently defeated Napoleon. Jackson‚Äôs army was a hodgepodge of militias, pirates, and volunteer citizens.
Confusing at times with lots of names to remember, but their context becomes clearer.

Title: Beat ever book on Battle of New Orleans

Review: This is an excellent recent history of the Battle of New Orleans. Its great strength is that the author makes extensive use of both American and British sources,

Title: detail without a over riding theme
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2020
Review: very detailed account that was very disappointing. Seemed far more interested in spending time dispelling myths than in telling the story. From the balance of detailed description in the book you would have thought the British won the battle not the other way around. Not very effective at telling the story but very bogged down in details many of which did not add to the story. Really not a first line choice to learn the history of the battle.
